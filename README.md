# flex-the-younger
Refactored, reconsidered FlexBox classes for 2019.


Way back when, I created a repo named **flexbox-classes** with many granular CSS classes to apply flex styling to elements. The repo mainly consists of a CSS file and a little educational PDF I stumbled upon that was developed by another party.  That repo was actually later cloned and published as an **npm** module which tickled my delight. (Hey! I'm on _npm_!)

It would have been even nicer if the cloner (or is it clowner?) had thrown a little tip-of-the-hat to me, but alas, it's the internet. Or maybe he had a headache or something.

Anyway, these days it's modern times, no?  

We can use an autoprefixer to add all the browser-specific classes. Plus, even I have grown tired of typing all the characters in the class names.

So herein a newer version. (It still includes the PDF, too.)

I'll leave the **npm** publishing to the habitues of the interwebs.
